## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"I don't see the price overlay."**
*   Ensure you are on a specific item page, not the search results.
*   Refresh the page.
*   Check if you are logged into the extension.

**"Watchlist notifications aren't appearing."**
*   Make sure browser notifications are enabled for Chrome.
*   The extension checks periodically (every 15-30 mins). Ensure Chrome is open.

**"I see a database error."**
*   If you see an error about "tables not found," please contact support. The system administrator needs to run a one-time database update.
