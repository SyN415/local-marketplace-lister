# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** December 10, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Local Marketplace Lister & Smart Scout ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide you with marketplace automation and intelligence features.

### 1.1 Marketplace Data
*   **Listings:** We process the listing information (title, price, description, images) you choose to cross-post or monitor.
*   **Search Queries:** We store the keywords and filters you save for your Smart Scout watchlists.
*   **Price Comparisons:** We track listing titles you view on supported marketplaces to fetch comparable price data from eBay.

### 1.2 Authentication Data
*   **User Account:** Email address and password (hashed) for account creation and login.
*   **Tokens:** Authentication tokens for connected services (e.g., Facebook, eBay) are processed securely but not stored in a way that allows us to access your accounts directly without your permission.

### 1.3 Usage Data
*   We collect anonymous usage metrics to improve extension performance and feature reliability.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **Cross-Posting:** To automate the creation of listings on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp.
*   **Smart Scout:** To provide real-time price intelligence and deal alerts based on your configured watchlists.
*   **Improvements:** To analyze feature usage and fix bugs.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

*   **Local Storage:** Sensitive data like your active session tokens for Facebook/Craigslist are stored locally in your browser (Chrome Extension storage) and are **never** transmitted to our servers.
*   **Server Storage:** Watchlist configurations, saved deals, and user profile data are stored in our secure database (Supabase).
*   **Encryption:** All data transmission between the extension and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL.

## 4. Third-Party Services

*   **eBay API:** We use the eBay Browse API to fetch price comparison data. We send only the item title to eBay; no personal information is shared.
*   **Supabase:** Our database and authentication provider.
*   **Stripe:** Payment processing (if applicable). We do not store credit card details.

### 5.3 Data Retention

## 6. Your Rights
